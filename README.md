Do you ever forget to take your keys when you leave the house? How about reminding yourself to pick up milk when close to the grocery store? You are in luck, because you now have all the skills to develop such an app! Your challenge is to develop a proximity reminder app which can remind you when you are close to a location or leaving a location.

You will need to use Core Location for geo-fencing, Core Data to save the reminders, and notifications for the reminder. A geo-fence is a virtual perimeter around a geographic area. The app should closely resemble the stock Reminders app in iOS.

The core objective is to create an app to display a local notification when entering or leaving a location. The app needs to allow the user to enter or search for a location and choose whether the reminder should be set for leaving or entering the location. For example, one should be able to set a reminder to pick up milk when close to a grocery store.

Don't forget to architect the app with readable and maintainable code.
At a minimum, your app should include the following features:

A basic master-detail view architecture

Ability to create reminders

Ability to edit and/or delete existing reminders

Geo-fence a reminder to a location so that you can display an alert notification when leaving or entering the location
